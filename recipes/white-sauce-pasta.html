    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ cups pasta (penne or fusilli works best)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
        <li>1½ cups milk (preferably warm)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated cheese (cheddar or mozzarella, optional for extra creaminess)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper powder</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon oregano (or Italian seasoning)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chili flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil (for boiling pasta)</li>
        <li>1 cup mixed vegetables (bell peppers, corn, carrots, broccoli – optional)</li>
        <li>2–3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Boil the pasta:</strong> In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp olive oil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente (firm to the bite). Drain and keep aside.</li>
        <li> <strong>Sauté the vegetables (optional):</strong> In a pan, heat a little butter or oil. Add chopped garlic and sauté for a few seconds. Add vegetables like bell peppers, corn, or broccoli. Cook for 3–4 minutes until slightly tender but still crunchy. Set aside.</li>
        <li> <strong>Prepare the white sauce:</strong> In another pan, melt 2 tbsp butter on low flame. Add 1½ tbsp all-purpose flour and stir continuously for 1–2 minutes until the raw smell disappears, and it turns slightly golden.</li>
        <li> <strong>Add milk gradually:</strong> Slowly pour in warm milk while whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Keep stirring until the sauce thickens and becomes smooth.</li>
        <li> <strong>Add seasonings and cheese:</strong> Add salt, black pepper, oregano, and chili flakes. Stir in grated cheese (optional) for extra creaminess. Mix well.</li>
        <li> <strong>Combine pasta and vegetables:</strong> Add the boiled pasta and sautéed vegetables to the sauce. Toss everything together until well coated and heated through.</li>
        <li> <strong>Serve hot:</strong> Garnish with extra herbs or cheese if desired. Serve immediately for best taste and texture.</li>
    </ol>
